# HitScoreVisualizerConfigs
Beat saber mod for selecting different hit score visualizer configs while the game is running!

# Setup
Download the HitScoreVisualizerConfigs.dll from Releases.
To add HSV configs, create a HSVConfigs folder in your BeatSaber/UserData folder and put all of the HSV configs (.json files) you want in there.
The configs will show up as their filename (minus the .json at the end) in the gameplay modifiers section of the game. Select whichever one you want to use and you're off!
